# digital-housing-platform

## 📌 Project Overview

The Digital Housing Platform is a modern web application designed to connect verified homeowners and renters. With real-time chat, video calls, advanced search by village, and Google authentication, the platform creates a more human, seamless housing experience. Future ML integration aims to predict renter payment reliability, while a robust reporting system ensures trust and accountability.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a friendly, real-world digital experience for property rental
- Enable seamless Google login and secure JSON Web Token (JWT) sessions
- Allow verified users to chat and video call in-app
- Empower renters to search by village and connect directly with owners
- Integrate ML to predict renter reliability (payment likelihood)
- Foster safety through mutual reviews and a reporting system
- Ensure scalability using Docker, MongoDB, and CI/CD pipelines

🚀 Getting Started

This project is under active development. To set up locally:
Clone the repository
Install dependencies (npm install)
Configure MongoDB connection and Google OAuth credentials
Run backend and frontend servers

### Local Development with Docker Compose

1. Copy environment files:

- Server: create `server/.env` with MongoDB, auth, and Cloudinary secrets.
- Client: create `client-next/.env.local` with frontend public env vars.

2. Run development stack:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml up --build
```

3. Open apps:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

4. Stop stack:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.dev.yml down
```

### Required Next.js Environment Variables

Set these in `client-next/.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
```
